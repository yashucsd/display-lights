 * Description:	A program that can set, clear, toggle, shift, rotate, and ripple

 * Date: 14 February 2017

Compilation: 	Compilation requires all of the following files: checkCmd.s,
				checkPrompt.c, clear.c, displayLights.s, pa2.h, pa2Strings.h,
				printChar.s, ripple.s, rotate.s, set.s, shift.s, and the some C
				libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, errno.h, unistd.h). Run
				'make' (acceses the make file) in the pa2 directory to compile
				these files.

How: 			To run the program, either choose a filename to follow ./pa2 as
				as an argument, for example: ./pa1 "file", or go without, and 
				use the prompt to manipulate a set (by calling 'set' command) of 
				lights (lightbank) with the follwoing commands: set, clear,
				toggle, shift, rotate, ripple, help or quit.

Output:			The program will output a text representation of the lights with
				dashes and asterisks after the given command is executed.

pa1$ ./pa2

> set 0x83838383 0x38383838
**** --** **** --** **** --** **** --** --** *--* --** *--* --** *--* --** *--*
> clear 0xf0f0f0f0 0x01010101
---- --** ---- --** ---- --** ---- --** --** *--- --** *--- --** *--- --** *---
> clear 0 0x00000008
---- --** ---- --** ---- --** ---- --** --** *--- --** *--- --** *--- --** ----
> toggle 1 15
---- --** ---- --** ---- --** ---- --*- --** *--- --** *--- --** *--- --** ****

				This is what an erroneous output would look like, it would
				print to stdout

pa2$ ./pa2

> rip
	
	Bad command. Type "help" for more info.


Testing:		Some logic-based assembly files (displayLights, set, shift) and
				the checkCmd C file were tested independently to make sure
				that their outputs were accurate. These are some of the inputs
				used to make sure that the outputs matched with expectations,
				testing the program

Normal									For Errors
./pa2 			 						./pa2 5 a a a a
./pa2 "file2"		 					./pa2 "nonexistantfile"

Questions: 		1.	mv oldname newname
				2.	cp location destination
				3.  it pastes
				4.  has initialisation commands, make a file ~/.vimrc and
					add what you need
				5.  dd, p
				6.  /searchterm
				7.  : set number
				8.  cd ~/fubar
				9.  chmod g+r
				10. It's illegal to steal intellecutal property and sell
				 	software claiming it as one's own. An engineer without
				 	integrity is not only useless in a professional environment
				 	but also is a threat to the success and reputation of said 
				 	environment.
